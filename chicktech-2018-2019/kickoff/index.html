                    <p>I used this line of code to get past the bandit level 13. The key for the next level was stored in /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 and could only be read by user bandit14. I determined that I had to move the file from the remote server to the localhost so I could use the key to access the next level, as this level does not return an actual password.</p>
